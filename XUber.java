/**
 * XUber is a ridesharing app for the XULA community.
 * The ridesharing vehicles are self-driving cars (max 4 occupants) and vans (max 8 occupants).
 * 
 * REGISTRATION
 * Only once, users register using their first name and XULA email address and then confirm
 * their registration by email and receive a unique rider key.
 * 
 * REQUEST A RIDE
 * To request a ride, a user merely types their key and destination and then the nearest available
 * vehicle is dispatched. Not every vehicle is available for every trip, instead the best vehicle is
 * dispatched based on the user's destination, the vehicle location, and the number of occupants
 * already in the vehicle.

 * Every destination is at an intersection and has a destination number like in the map.txt file.
